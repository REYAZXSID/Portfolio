## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated violet (#800080) for a sense of creativity and professionalism.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0) to maintain a light scheme, almost of the same hue as the primary color but heavily desaturated and brighter to ensure legibility and contrast.
- Accent color: Purple (#A020F0), an analogous hue to the violet, for highlights and call-to-actions.
- Font for headings: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for an elegant, stylish aesthetic, best for short bursts of text.
- Font for body text: 'Alegreya' (serif) for readability and to complement the headline font.
- Use line-style icons for skills and social media links to maintain a clean look.
- Use a grid layout for the skills and project sections, and ensure responsiveness.
- Use subtle animations like fade-ins and slide-ins powered by Framer Motion.
